#Cities App

A framgment of an app I've been working on about places to visit on Brazil. This branch implements
the City selector if the user does not select any before dive into the application.

The main goal is to break the screen to give a sense of importance of the first step, select a city
to proceed, if not done yet. More screens and info at my Dribbble profile:

PS: The Podfile is setup but no pod since I declined to use it.

Hope it helps :)
